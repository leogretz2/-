# This is a simple script file that can be executed by
# test-allocator.  A script is simply a sequence of requests.
# Each request is a single line, consisting of operation
# and its arguments (id and size). There are three
# types of requests:
#
#    allocate:    a id size
#    reallocate:  r id size
#    free:        f id
#
# The "id" arguments are numbers from 0 to N
# that are used to identify the different pointers
# being allocated/freed.
